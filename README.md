## Boxnovel Scraper
A simple app for scraping multiple chapters of a light novel in Boxnovel.com (and Readlightnovel.org too) into one page. Very useful for sending the entire page to a Kindle device using the Send to Kindle official extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-kindle-for-google/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea?hl=en)).

Note: Due to limitations of the CORS-Anywhere API used, the maximum amount of chapters included in a page will never exceed 200 every hour.
